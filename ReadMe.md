Store and execute(No dependencies required as .net will be installed on most windows 10 computers by default)


Info:
Do you want to prank your friends?

Say no more!

This fake windows XP Updater is designed to scare the shit of many windows users.
A windows update is by far the most feared moment for all windows loving people so 
use this moment wisely to prank your friends, school, colleagues and so forth.This works 
on all versions of Windows ranging from Windows XP, Windows 10 and Windows 11. When the program
is executed, it will automatically decide how long the windows update should go for(even for 10mins). 
This process wont appear on the taskbar so it is super stealthy. 


What language is this written in ?
C# along with some C++ libraries for communication with the kernel, triggering BSOD and other etc... 

Why no source code?

Although, it is very simple and easy to code, i have decided not to place the source files as i 
fear that my code may be misused for illegal purposes which i strongly condemn. 



How to close WinXP Updater?
1. Open up Task Manager
2. Find a process named "Security Update.exe"
3. Select the process
4. Do a right mouse click and select endtask to close the process

Note: Once it goes to the BSOD stage, this action cannot be done so the user 
needs to wait until the BSOD finishes. This should take only about a few minutes but no more
than an hour(if the pc has an average performance rate)
